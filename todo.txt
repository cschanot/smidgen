1. Find a way to display tweets in a prettier format. [DONE]

    - https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-for-websites/embedded-tweets/overview
    ** Done with the above implementation, however this seems UI heavy and may need to be changed later to tweet text only etc. **

2. Parse/organize JSON data for analytics/machine learning. [DONE]
    - It's already in a dictionary as far as Python in concerned so this shouldn't be too bad?!
    ** Done for now, but the logic for stripping stop words and symbols can be better **
    ** Can't handle emojis or apostrophes **

3. Different implementation for displaying login/logout button. They flash on page refresh as the user is being reauthenticated by firebase. [DONE]
    - Use localstorage boolean instead of reauthing every refresh?
    ** Fixed (for now) by hiding ALL buttons initially, then loading only the appropriate one. **
