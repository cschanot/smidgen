1. Move more functions from search.js -> server side if possible.
2. Utilize firebase in (1)
3. Test functionality on EECIS
4. Test walkthrough after 1-2.

Other:
1. Some form of feedback when a multi-query is being performed, given it can take a while due to rate-limits.
2. Relevant/Not relevant button (checkbox makes the most sense here I think?)
    - Relevant sets a value to 1 -- Will this need a label (what it was relevant to - perhaps the project title handles this)? 
       > Should you be able to do this when searaching?
       > If you can should there be a "save relevant tweets" button so the irrelavant ones are discarded?
