1. Find a way to display tweets in a prettier format.

2. Parse/organize JSON data for analytics/machine learning.
    - It's already in a dictionary as far as Python in concerned so this shouldn't be too bad?!

3. Different implementation for displaying login/logout button. They flash on page refresh as the user is being reauthenticated by firebase.
    - Use localstorage boolean instead of reauthing every refresh?
    - Fixed (for now) by hiding ALL buttons initially, then loading only the appropriate one.
