1. Find a way to display tweets in a prettier format. [DONE]
    - https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-for-websites/javascript-api/guides/set-up-twitter-for-websites
    - https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-for-websites/embedded-tweets/guides/embedded-tweet-javascript-factory-function
    - https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-for-websites/embedded-tweets/overview
    ** Done with the above implementation, however this seems UI heavy and may need to be changed later to tweet text only etc. **

2. Parse/organize JSON data for analytics/machine learning. [DONE]
    - It's already in a dictionary as far as Python in concerned so this shouldn't be too bad?!
    ** Done for now, but the logic for stripping stop words and symbols can be better ** [Fixed?!]
    ** Can't handle emojis or apostrophes ** [Fixed]
    

3. Different implementation for displaying login/logout button. They flash on page refresh as the user is being reauthenticated by firebase. [DONE]
    - Use localstorage boolean instead of reauthing every refresh?
    ** Fixed (for now) by hiding ALL buttons initially, then loading only the appropriate one. **

4. Find a way to keep links intact, and perhaps @mentions and #hashtags as these are destroyed during parsing/stripping.

5. Multi-Query:
   - If a query returns no results, display that, for example
   > User searches the multi query "test" + "1ausg08708g08ausdgiopu0"
   > The 2nd query "1ausg08708g08ausdgiopu0" likely returned nothing, and you simply have a list of tweets with "test"
   > Revoke merging the 2nd empty list and tell the user no results for "1ausg08708g08ausdgiopu0", display the rest of the list as it already does.
